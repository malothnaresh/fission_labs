      <h4>Steps followed are:</h4>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>First, checked out the angular-seed app from npm to kick start the project, instead of defining the folder structure and others from start point</li>
        <li>Now, added lodash, highcharts, bootstrap, jqeury to support bootstrap</li>
        <li>Provided a input field for reading the csv file</li>
        <li>After file uploaded, loading its contents from a directive named <i><strong>fileReader</strong></i></li>
        <li>Once file contents are rendered.. in function readCsv, parsing, validating and invoking drawChart is handled</li>
        <li>Alternatives tried for csv to json conversion : csv2json package, jquery-csv package</li>
        <li>But, they are not much developer friendly. So, designed my own parsing technique</li>
      </ul>
