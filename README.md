Please do npm install on master folder "angular-seed"
bower install in /app folder
now come back to master folder
To start the server, say npm start
It would load your files on "localhost:8000"
It has it's own server defined to load the files.
So, do not keep under any web server's webapps
It works ? Great...:)
